            <p>Aurora Aksnes (born 15 June 1996),[2][3] known mononymously as Aurora (stylized in all caps),[4] is a 
                Norwegian singer, songwriter and record producer. Born in Stavanger and raised in the towns of HÃ¸le and Os,
                 she began writing her first songs and learning dance at the age of six.
                 After some of her songs were uploaded online and became popular in Norway, she signed a recording
                  contract with Petroleum Records, Decca and Glassnote Records[5] in 2014. Aurora gained recognition
                   with her debut extended play (EP), Running with the Wolves (2015), which contained the sleeper hit 
                   "Runaway". Later that year, she provided the backing track for the John Lewis Christmas advert,
                    singing a cover of the Oasis song "Half the World Away".

                Aurora's debut studio album, All My Demons Greeting Me as a Friend (2016) 
                received generally positive reviews, charting in various European countries and earning platinum 
                certification two times in Norway. Her second EP Infections of a Different Kind (Step 1) 
                (2018) was the first part of a two-part album, which the second part was her second studio album,
                 A Different Kind of Human (Step 2) (2019). Her third studio album The Gods We Can Touch was released on
                  21 January 2022.
                
                Her music is primarily electropop, folk, and art pop with vocals referred to as "ethereal".
                 She only played piano at the beginning of her career, but later involved herself in percussion and other
                  aspects of music production. In addition to her solo work, Aurora has collaborated with and co-written
                   songs for other artists, including Icarus, Askjell, Lena, Travis and The Chemical Brothers.
                    She has also contributed to soundtracks for several films and television series,
                     including Girls, Frozen II and Wolfwalkers </p>
